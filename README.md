## Yeah... Why?
Well I don't really know, but here's a POS if you want to manage sales for a GIGANTIC cinema...
Enjoy!

## The 2023 Update
Who knew I'd be coming back to this proyect so soon! I'll be doing a dynamic array for the reservation system, chaining several proyection rooms (1-3), where they'll proyect several movies throughout the day (with various timestamps). The new version will include Billing (through a .md file as invoice, with Credit Card data, seats booked and maybe a QR code), Ticket validation, Data persistency and more! So get ready, Cinema-POS is about to get bigger (and useful).
